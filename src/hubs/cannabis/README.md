# Luma Core — Cannabis / Health Compliance Hub

The **Cannabis Hub** provides end-to-end compliance workflows for medical
cannabis, pharmacies, clinics, regulators, and supply-chain operators.

It uses Luma Core’s audit-by-default architecture to ensure every action —
from prescription to dispense — is fully verifiable and compliant.

This hub is aligned with:
- medical cannabis regulations  
- pharmacy dispensing rules  
- clinician prescribing guidelines  
- controlled-substance audit standards  
- supply-chain traceability requirements

## 🌿 Core Workflows

### **1. Prescription Issuing**

### **2. Pharmacy Dispense**

### **4. Supply-Chain Traceability**
Every step emits a receipt.

## 🔐 Compliance & Policy Rules

Policies embedded into receipts:
- age and identity  
- clinician licence validation  
- prescription validity window  
- repeat / refill rules  
- controlled substance limits  
- pharmacy licence rules  

All policy decisions are stored inside the receipt for regulator audit.
