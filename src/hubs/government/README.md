# Luma Core — Government Hub

The **Government Hub** provides sovereign-grade digital workflows, audit receipts,
and policy enforcement for public administration, justice, social services, and
national operations.

It demonstrates how Luma Core can unify fragmented systems into a single,
offline-capable, verifiable audit layer that strengthens trust, compliance,
and accountability across government institutions.

## 🏛 Core Government Use Cases

- Identity & citizen services  
- Case management (health, justice, welfare, utilities)  
- Licensing & permits  
- Evidence chains / case audit trails  
- Enforcement workflows (optional multi-signature)  
- Rescue operations & emergency coordination  
- Infrastructure & utility events  
- Cross-department data integrity  

All workflows generate **tamper-evident, hash-linked receipts**.

## 🔧 Key Workflows

### **1. Case Creation**

### **2. Case Update / Evidence Event**

### **3. Case Closure**

### **4. Inter-department Transfer**

## 🛡 Policy Enforcement

Government workflows apply jurisdiction-defined rules:

- age, residency, identity  
- officer/agent role permissions  
- evidence handling  
- social/health case policies  
- utilities/inspection rules  
- cross-department access  
- optional multi-signature events  

Every policy result is embedded in the receipt.
