# Luma Core — Overview

Luma Core is a sovereign, offline-first digital infrastructure framework designed
to unify government, finance, health, utilities, justice and regulated industries
under one verifiable audit layer.

Its primary purpose is to replace fragile, cloud-dependent, siloed public systems
with an **integrity-first, receipt-driven architecture** that continues operating
under any network condition — even fully offline.
